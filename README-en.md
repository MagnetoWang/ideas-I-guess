This is my technology blog, specifically summarizing and summarizing 
some technical experience and exploring new technologies in the future


## My Experience

- The first step to solving a problem is to do it yourself.
- The first step in understanding an algorithm is to calculate it.
- Try using paper and pen to write algorithms.
- To quickly master a certain field of technology,  you need to go to experts or articles in that field.
- Good design is worth learning and transplanting
- Always learn source code with question/needs/goals/interests/benefits
- The more you read, the more you learn, and the more innovative drive you have.
- Material cycles need to constantly updated.
