This is my technology blog, specifically summarizing and summarizing 
some technical experience and exploring new technologies in the future


## My Experience

- The first step to solving a problem is to do it yourself.
- The first step in understanding an algorithm is to calculate it.
- Try using paper and pen to write algorithms.
- To quickly master a certain field of technology,  you need to go to experts or articles in that field.
