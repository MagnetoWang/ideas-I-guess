## [Apache Commons Codec](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-codec/)

Apache Commons Codec (TM) software provides implementations of common encoders and decoders such as Base64, Hex, Phonetic and URLs.

### Impetus

Codec was formed as an attempt to focus development effort on one definitive implementation of the Base64 encoder. At the time of Codec's proposal, there were approximately 34 different Java classes that dealt with Base64 encoding spread over the Foundation's CVS repository. Developers in the Jakarta Tomcat project had implemented an original version of the Base64 codec which had been copied by the Commons HttpClient and Apache XML project's XML-RPC subproject. After almost one year, the two forked versions of Base64 had significantly diverged from one another. XML-RPC had applied numerous fixes and patches which were not applied to the Commons HttpClient Base64. Different subprojects had differing implementations at various levels of compliance with the [RFC 2045](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2045.txt).

Out of that confusing duplication of effort sprang this simple attempt to encourage code reuse among various projects. While this package contains a abstract framework for the creation of encoders and decoders, Codec itself is primarily focused on providing functional utilities for working with common encodings.

## [Commons Chain](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-chain/) 

The essence of computing might be that for any expected input (A), we return the expected output (B). The challenge is getting from (A) to (B). For a simple program, (A) to (B) might be a single transformation. Say, shifting a character code 32 digits so that "a" becomes "A". In a complex application, A to B can be a long and winding road.

We might need to confirm that the user is authorized to create (B) from (A). We might need to find that (A) is valid input for (B). We might need to convert (A) from another character set. We may need to insert a preamble before writing (B). We may need to merge another resource with (A) before creating (B). Meanwhile, if anything goes wrong during processing, the error must be handled, and even logged. Some tasks might be able to continue after a non-fatal error, or, if the error is fatal, all processing might need to halt.

There are many different ways programmers organize processing logic within an application. Often, the difference between an elegant architecture and a muddled ball-of mud is how control flows from one process to another. To realize and retain elegance, we must organize complex, multi-step processes so that they are easy to discover and change.

## [Commons Collections](http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-collections/)

The [Java Collections Framework](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/collections/) was a major addition in JDK 1.2. It added many powerful data structures that accelerate development of most significant Java applications. Since that time it has become the recognised standard for collection handling in Java.

Commons-Collections seek to build upon the JDK classes by providing new interfaces, implementations and utilities. There are many features, including:

- Bag interface for collections that have a number of copies of each object
- BidiMap interface for maps that can be looked up from value to key as well and key to value
- MapIterator interface to provide simple and quick iteration over maps
- Transforming decorators that alter each object as it is added to the collection
- Composite collections that make multiple collections look like one
- Ordered maps and sets that retain the order elements are added in, including an LRU based map
- Reference map that allows keys and/or values to be garbage collected under close control
- Many comparator implementations
- Many iterator implementations
- Adapter classes from array and enumerations to collections
- Utilities to test or create typical set-theory properties of collections such as union, intersection, and closure

### 作用

## [Apache Commons Compress™](http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-compress/)

The Apache Commons Compress library defines an API for working with ar, cpio, Unix dump, tar, zip, gzip, XZ, Pack200, bzip2, 7z, arj, lzma, snappy, DEFLATE, lz4, Brotli, Zstandard, DEFLATE64 and Z files.

The code in this component has many origins:

- The bzip2, tar and zip support came from Avalon's Excalibur, but originally from Ant, as far as life in Apache goes. The tar package is originally Tim Endres' public domain package. The bzip2 package is based on the work done by Keiron Liddle as well as Julian Seward's [libbzip2](http://www.bzip.org/index.html). It has migrated via:
  Ant -> Avalon-Excalibur -> Commons-IO -> Commons-Compress.
- The cpio package has been contributed by Michael Kuss and the [jRPM](http://jrpm.sourceforge.net/) project.

### 作用

 支持tar、zip和bzip2文件操作的API。 





## [commons-configuration](http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-configuration/)

Commons Configuration provides typed access to single, and multi-valued configuration parameters as demonstrated by the following code:

```
Double double = config.getDouble("number");
Integer integer = config.getInteger("number");
```

Configuration parameters may be loaded from the following sources:

- Properties files
- XML documents
- Windows INI files
- Property list files (plist)
- JNDI
- JDBC Datasource
- System properties
- Applet parameters
- Servlet parameters

## [Commons CSV](http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-csv/)

Commons CSV reads and writes files in variations of the Comma Separated Value (CSV) format.

The most common CSV formats are predefined in the [CSVFormat](http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-csv/apidocs/org/apache/commons/csv/CSVFormat.html) class:

- Microsoft Excel
- [Informix UNLOAD](http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSBJG3_2.5.0/com.ibm.gen_busug.doc/c_fgl_InOutSql_UNLOAD.htm)
- [Informix UNLOAD CSV](http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSBJG3_2.5.0/com.ibm.gen_busug.doc/c_fgl_InOutSql_UNLOAD.htm)
- [MySQL](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/mysqldump-delimited-text.html)
- [RFC 4180](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180)
- [TDF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tab-separated_values)

Custom formats can be created using a fluent style API.

## [The DBCP Component](http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-dbcp/)

Many Apache projects support interaction with a relational database. Creating a new connection for each user can be time consuming (often requiring multiple seconds of clock time), in order to perform a database transaction that might take milliseconds. Opening a connection per user can be unfeasible in a publicly-hosted Internet application where the number of simultaneous users can be very large. Accordingly, developers often wish to share a "pool" of open connections between all of the application's current users. The number of users actually performing a request at any given time is usually a very small percentage of the total number of active users, and during request processing is the only time that a database connection is required. The application itself logs into the DBMS, and handles any user account issues internally.

There are several Database Connection Pools already available, both within Apache products and elsewhere. This Commons package provides an opportunity to coordinate the efforts required to create and maintain an efficient, feature-rich package under the ASF license.

The `commons-dbcp2` package relies on code in the `commons-pool2` package to provide the underlying object pool mechanisms that it utilizes.

DBCP now comes in three different versions to support different versions of JDBC. Here is how it works:

- DBCP 2 compiles and runs under Java 7 only (JDBC 4.1)
- DBCP 1.4 compiles and runs under Java 6 only (JDBC 4)
- DBCP 1.3 compiles and runs under Java 1.4-5 only (JDBC 3)







## [The Digester Component](http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-digester/)

Many projects read XML configuration files to provide initialization of various Java objects within the system. There are several ways of doing this, and the *Digester* component was designed to provide a common implementation that can be used in many different projects.

Basically, the *Digester* package lets you configure an XML -> Java object mapping module, which triggers certain actions called *rules* whenever a particular pattern of nested XML elements is recognized. A rich set of predefined *rules* is available for your use, or you can also create your own.

### 作用

 映射XML到Java对象的工具。 





## [Commons Discovery: Service Discovery component](http://commons.apache.org/dormant/commons-discovery/)

The Discovery component is about discovering, or finding, implementations for pluggable interfaces. It provides facilities for instantiating classes in general, and for lifecycle management of singleton (factory) classes.

Fundamentally, Discovery locates classes that implement a given Java interface. The discovery pattern, though not necessarily this package, is used in many projects including JAXP (SaxParserFactory and others) and commons-logging (LogFactory). By extracting this pattern, other projects can (re)use it and take advantage of improvements to the pattern as Discovery evolves.

Discovery improves over previous implementations by establishing facilities for working within managed environments. These allow configuration and property overrides without appealing to the global System properties (which are scoped across an entire JVM).

### 作用

## [Commons Email](http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-email/)

Commons Email aims to provide a API for sending email. It is built on top of the Java Mail API, which it aims to simplify.

Some of the mail classes that are provided are as follows:

- **SimpleEmail** - This class is used to send basic text based emails.
- **MultiPartEmail** - This class is used to send multipart messages. This allows a text message with attachments either inline or attached.
- **HtmlEmail** - This class is used to send HTML formatted emails. It has all of the capabilities as MultiPartEmail allowing attachments to be easily added. It also supports embedded images.
- **ImageHtmlEmail** - This class is used to send HTML formatted emails with inline images. It has all of the capabilities as HtmlEmail but transform all image references to inline images.
- **EmailAttachment** - This is a simple container class to allow for easy handling of attachments. It is for use with instances of MultiPartEmail and HtmlEmail.

### 作用

## [Apache Commons Exec](http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-exec/)

### Rationale

Executing external processes from Java is a well-known problem area. It is inheriently platform dependent and requires the developer to know and test for platform specific behaviors, for example using cmd.exe on Windows or limited buffer sizes causing deadlocks. The JRE support for this is very limited, albeit better with the Java SE 1.5 ProcessBuilder class.

Reliably executing external processes can also require knowledge of the environment variables before or after the command is executed. In J2SE 1.1-1.4 there is not support for this, since the method, `System.getenv()`, for retrieving environment variables is deprecated.

There are currently several different libraries that for their own purposes have implemented frameworks around `Runtime.exec()` to handle the various issues outlined above. The proposed project should aim at coordinating and learning from these initiatives to create and maintain a simple, reusable and well-tested package. Since some of the more problematic platforms are not readily available, it is our hope that the broad Apache community can be a great help.

### 作用

## [Commons FileUpload](http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-fileupload/)

The Commons **FileUpload** package makes it easy to add robust, high-performance, file upload capability to your servlets and web applications.

FileUpload parses HTTP requests which conform to [RFC 1867](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1867.txt), "Form-based File Upload in HTML". That is, if an HTTP request is submitted using the POST method, and with a content type of "multipart/form-data", then FileUpload can parse that request, and make the results available in a manner easily used by the caller.

Starting with version **1.3**, FileUpload handles [RFC 2047](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2047.txt) encoded header values.

The simplest way to send a *multipart/form-data* request to a server is via a web form, i.e.

```
<form method="POST" enctype="multipart/form-data" action="fup.cgi">
  File to upload: <input type="file" name="upfile"><br/>
  Notes about the file: <input type="text" name="note"><br/>
  <br/>
  <input type="submit" value="Press"> to upload the file!
</form>
```

## [Apache Commons Net](http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-net/)

Apache Commons Net™ library implements the client side of many basic Internet protocols. The purpose of the library is to provide fundamental protocol access, not higher-level abstractions. Therefore, some of the design violates object-oriented design principles. Our philosophy is to make the global functionality of a protocol accessible (e.g., TFTP send file and receive file) when possible, but also provide access to the fundamental protocols where applicable so that the programmer may construct his own custom implementations (e.g, the TFTP packet classes and the TFTP packet send and receive methods are exposed).

## Features

Supported protocols include:

- FTP/FTPS
- FTP over HTTP (experimental)
- NNTP
- SMTP(S)
- POP3(S)
- IMAP(S)
- Telnet
- TFTP
- Finger
- Whois
- rexec/rcmd/rlogin
- Time (rdate) and Daytime
- Echo
- Discard
- NTP/SNTP

## [Commons Validator](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-validator/)

A common issue when receiving data either electronically or from user input is verifying the integrity of the data. This work is repetitive and becomes even more complicated when different sets of validation rules need to be applied to the same set of data based on locale. Error messages may also vary by locale. This package addresses some of these issues to speed development and maintenance of validation rules.

## [Apache Commons RNG: Random Numbers Generators](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-rng/)

Commons RNG provides implementations of pseudo-random numbers generators that are either faster or of higher quality (and sometimes both) than `java.util.Random`.

Casual use is as simple as:

```
import org.apache.commons.rng.UniformRandomProvider;
import org.apache.commons.rng.simple.RandomSource;

// Instantiate a "Mersenne-Twister" generator with a factory method.
UniformRandomProvider rng = RandomSource.create(RandomSource.MT);

// Use it to produce a floating-point value between 0 and 1.
double random = rng.nextDouble();
```

For more examples and more advanced usage, see the [userguide](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-rng/userguide/rng.html).

Commons RNG is intended to be a repository of pure Java implementations of random number generators that produce deterministic sequences. The current design has made no provision for features generally needed for cryptography applications (e.g. strong unpredictability).

The emphasis is on state-of-the-art generators that pass stringent uniformity tests such as [TU01](http://simul.iro.umontreal.ca/testu01/tu01.html) and [Dieharder](http://www.phy.duke.edu/~rgb/General/dieharder.php). Weaker algorithms, with known shortcomings, are also provided (for reference or due to their historical importance) but their use is best avoided in new applications.

## Copybara

### A tool for transforming and moving code between repositories

Copybara is a tool that transforms and moves code between repositories.

Often, source code needs to exist in multiple repositories, and Copybara allows you to transform and move source code between these repositories. A common case is a project that involves maintaining a confidential repository and a public repository in sync.

Copybara requires you to choose one of the repositories to be the authoritative repository, so that there is always one source of truth. However, the tool allows contributions to any repository, and any repository can be used to cut a release.

The most common use case involves repetitive movement of code from one repository to another. Copybara can also be used for moving code once to a new repository.

Examples uses of Copybara include:

- Importing sections of code from a confidential repository to a public repository.
- Importing code from a public repository to a confidential repository.
- Importing a change from a non-authoritative repository into the authoritative repository. When a change is made in the non-authoritative repository (for example, a contributor in the public repository), Copybara transforms and moves that change into the appropriate place in the authoritative repository. Any merge conflicts are dealt with in the same way as an out-of-date change within the authoritative repository.

Currently, the only supported type of repository is Git, Folder and Google internal VCS. Support for other repositories types (such as Hg) will be added in the future.

Copybara is similar to MOE, which is a tool to synchronize between source code repositories. Copybara’s design has learned much from MOE, and will have ongoing support.

### How Google uses Copybara

Google uses this project, and its older, sister project [MOE](http://github.com/google/moe) to release sources from hundreds of internal projects to open source repositories on GitHub, and elsewhere. It uses these tools to scrub private or internal information from sources, replay commits in order to maintain equivalent source-trees automatically, as well as to facilitate bringing changes into Google’s internal repository.

## [Protobuf](https://opensource.google.com/projects/protobuf)

### Google's data interchange format

Protobuf is short for protocol buffers, which are language- and platform-neutral mechanisms for serializing structured data for use in communications protocols, data storage, and more. Think XML, but smaller, faster, and simpler. You define how you want your data to be structured once, then you can use special generated source code to easily write and read your structured data to and from a variety of data streams and using a variety of languages. You can even update your data structure without breaking deployed programs that are compiled against the “old” format – this is especially useful in Google, where a new rollout of a server usually has to start out talking to older servers.

## [Zopfli](https://github.com/google/zopfli)

### Zopfli is a compression library designed to be very good, but slow

Zopfli is a compression library that achieves higher compression density while taking longer to compress. The smaller compressed size allows for better space utilization, faster data transmission, and lower web page load latencies. Furthermore, the smaller compressed size has additional benefits in mobile use, such as lower data transfer fees and reduced battery use. The higher data density is achieved by using more exhaustive compression techniques, which make the compression a lot slower, but do not affect the decompression speed.

Zopfli is bit-stream compatible with compression used in gzip, Zip, PNG, HTTP requests, and others.

### How Google uses Zopfli

Zopfli has been used to save storage space and reduce the bandwidth required to send PNG images to users of Google products.







## [TouchTime](https://github.com/google/TouchTime)

### Tells the time through vibration patterns on an Android smartwatch

Google uses @AutoValue in almost every project whenever we want simple types that correctly implement the equals/hashCode contract in Java. @AutoService is used in hundreds of our annotation processors and static analysis tools that are dynamically loaded using the service provider pattern. @AutoFactory is used in dependency-injection systems when some, but not all of an objects dependencies are provided in the graph and others change during each use. These, and many other annotation processors, take advantage of the utilities in auto-common to simplify interactions with the java compiler APIs.

## JCache

JCache is bootstrapped through the presence of a javax.cache.spi.CachingProvider on
the classpath (that is, a JSR-107 compliant caching library exists on the classpath), and the
JCacheCacheManager is provided by the spring-boot-starter-cache “Starter”. Various
compliant libraries are available, and Spring Boot provides dependency management for Ehcache 3,
Hazelcast, and Infinispan. Any other compliant library can be added as well.
